# Fluid Framework Vue Examples Repository

This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with the Fluid Framework and Vue. For documentation about the Fluid Framework, go to https://FluidFramework.com. The Fluid Framework repository lives at https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework.

Each example is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage. To get started, clone the repo, go into a
example folder that you want to run, and follow the instructions in the example's `readme.md` file.

If you're using VS Code and don't already have the [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur&WT.mc_id=m365-0000-dwahlin) extension installed we recommend installing it.
